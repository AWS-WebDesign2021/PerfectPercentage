  <h3>Likes and Dislikes about this project :</h3>
  <p><b>> This project was a really informative one to make and it was interesting figuring out the keyframes and just seeing the transition effects work.</b></p>
  <p><b>> One thing that I encountered when writing the code for this website was to present the animation as it would often times not work or there would be something wrong with the keyframes setting.</b></p>
  <p><b>> It was very accomplishing to see the hovering transitions and the starting animation work.</b></p>
