<h3>Goals for this project :</h3>
<p><b>> The main goals for this project was to be able to link the html file to the css file and to be able to use a complex css function.</b></p>
<p><b>> For this project we were introduced to a lot of different css functions such as shawdowns and dropdowns.</b></p>

<h3>Likes and Dislikes about this project :</h3>
<p><b>> This project was a really interesting one to make although it was quite challenging.</b></p>
<p><b>> One thing that I encountered when writing the code for this website was to position my navigation bar and its list items organizedly. I did figure out a way to locate them but it still looks a little bit weird.</b></p>
