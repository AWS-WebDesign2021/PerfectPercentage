<h3>Brief Introduction :</h3>
<p><b>> This Project was the first project that we learnt to connect branch pages and use png to link webpages.</b></p>
<p><b>> The website introduces and talks about the collection of album cards of TWICE, a kpop girlgroup.</b></p>

<h3>Goals for this project :</h3>
<p><b>> The main goals for this project was to be able to create branch pages in the same file folder and be able to link them so the user doesn't get stuck on a page.</b></p>
<p><b>> For this project we were also introduced to "Table", "table rows", and "table data".</b></p>

<h3>Likes and Dislikes about this project :</h3>
<p><b>> This project was a really fun one to make as it was also our first partner project.</b></p>
<p><b>> The most difficult part about this project was probably to code on just one laptop when you have two people.</b></p>
<p><b>> One of the challenging things of this project was also to use the table element, as I sometimes messes up between table row and table data.</b></p>

  <!-- using a png instead of hypertext to link the original website, target blank so user does not leave the original branch page-->
