  <h3>Brief Introduction :</h3>
  <p><b>> This Project was the first project that we used a form and approached the JavaScript language.</b></p>
  <p><b>> The website is inspired by buzzfeed quizzes and tells you a cuisine you should try based on your boba tea order.</b></p>

  <h3>Goals for this project :</h3>
  <p><b>> The main goals for this project was to be able to write a form and it's matching JavaScript and to have it actually work.</b></p>
  <p><b>> For this project we went really creative and completely random with the questions and the outcomes.</b></p>

  <h3>Likes and Dislikes about this project :</h3>
  <p><b>> This project was a really funny and random one to finish although it was really hard and I met quite a few obstacles.</b></p>
  <p><b>> One thing that I encountered when writing the code for this website was to MAKE THE JAVASCRIPT WORK. The outcomes kept on glitching and the Javascript didn't work so I was really frustrated.</b></p>
  <p><b>> I really had a lot of fun making this project as to match the outcomes with the choices people make as they seemed to make sense but at the same time was ridiculously funny.</b></p>
