<h3>Brief Introduction :</h3>
<p><b>> These Projects were some of our first projects, we were just trying to be able to present text on a website, use styling, and place images.</b></p>
<p><b>> The recurring dream website has a short story on it, talking about a recurring dream.</b></p>
<p><b>> The gopher website has a some brief information on it about gophers and some random facts, along with images and a gif.</b></p>
<p><b>> For the recurring dreams project we also went back and edited the text's style when we first approached css styling.</b></p>
    </div>

<h3>Goals for these projects :</h3>
<p><b>> For the recurring dreams project was mainly on just simply being able to present text and uploading the project onto Github.</b></p>
<p><b>> However, we did got a chance to just play around with different font styles you can do using css later on.</b></p>
<p><b>> For the gopher project we learnt about styling the websites and how to put images on it.</b></p>

<h3>Likes and Dislikes about these projects :</h3>
<p><b>> Writing the recurring dreams story was really fun.</b></p>
<p><b>> However, the first project did lack a bit of content and now looking at it, things could've been styled more and not just words on the website.</b></p>
<p><b>> The making of the gopher project was really interesting as I didn't know a lot of this animal before.</b></p>
<p><b>> Aligning the piuctures when making this project was one of the biggest challenges but I really liked how it turned out organized at last.</b></p>
