<h1 class="sub">'Brief Intro About Website'</h1>
<p class="introo">> This page was <i>A Travel Guide to Taiwan - Spring Season</i></p>
<p class="introo">> Basic Info / Sceneries / Food / Traveling / COVID situation in Taiwan was introduced.</p>
<p class="introo">> It was a multiple page website , my first big project this school year.</p>
<p class="introo">> I took on a more different design between home and branch pages , as well as the header and nav bar.</p>
<p class="introo">> The style I used in this website I was able to incorporate a layout feeling with setting div width to 50% and 50% of the page.</p>

<h1 class="sub">'Reflection'</h1>
<p class="introo">> I really enjoyed making this site because it was about my home country , so I was extra excited to introduce it to people.</p>
<p class="introo">> I reviewed my previous code for the navigation bar and understood how each element played their roles, from then I was able to even further custom the navigation bar to my design.</p>
<p class="introo">> Playing with display percentages , having a design layout became easier without having to continually guess the pixels.</p>
<p class="introo">> I also had the chance to test out the overflow : scroll function under the pages and it was fascinating.</p>
<p class="introo">> One thing I would've changed about this website would be to better design the feedback page.</p>
