<h1 class="sub">'Brief Intro About Website'</h1>
<p class="introo">> This page was about <i>Environmental Call to Action </i></p>
<p class="introo">> The Social issue of overpopulation was discussed along with possible solutions</p>
<p class="introo">> It was an one page website , I still incorporated a navigation bar , but it was linked within the page. (using id)</p>
<p class="introo">> During the making of this page I used the "style" element rather than linking a css file</p>
<p class="introo">> The style I used for this website was one that I was familiar with , creating contrast between certain color using div backgrounds and text.</p>

<h1 class="sub">'Reflection'</h1>
<p class="introo">> This was one of the first pages I worked on after picking up web deisgn after a year.</p>
<p class="introo">> The making of this website allowed me to slowly remember and review coding a website.</p>
<p class="introo">> It was also a very nice oppurtunity to look into overpopulation , and to raise awareness to whoever I showcased my website to.</p>
<p class="introo">> One thing I would change was that I would've wanted to take on a different style rather than the one I've always used.</p>
<p class="introo">> One thing that I really liked was that the website layout was clear to understand and easy to navigate.</p>
