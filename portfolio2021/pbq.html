<h1 class="sub">'Brief Intro About Website'</h1>
<p class="introo">> This page was about <i>DESIGNING A BUZZFEED QUIZ</i>!!</p>
<p class="introo">> Hands down , 10/10 , definitely my favorite project of the year.</p>
<p class="introo">> The requirements for this website was to design a working buzzfeed quiz that gives users different results based on their answers / selections.</p>
<p class="introo">> Designing this website also made me realize how IMPORTANT comments are. For once I can look at my code a long time later and still be able to conprehend what each section stood for.</p>
<p class="introo">> Main Focus of this Project : Forms and JavaScript</p>
<p class="introo">> Special Requirement for this website : advertisement</p>

<h1 class="sub">'Reflection'</h1>
<p class="introo">> To start off , this website was extremely frustrating to make.</p>
<p class="introo">> JavaScript is very useful and interesting , but also is just a total pain to deal with.</p>
<p class="introo">> BUT !! I was introduced to the concept of parameters and I am OBSSESSED with the new world it led me to. It made coding the JavaScript so much more convenient.</p>
<p class="introo">> I did meet a roadblock when trying to calculate the total points for the user to land in different results , it was quickly fixed when Mr.Considine pointed out that I should've been using == for equal to rather than = ..-_- (but hey it was solved)</p>
<p class="introo">> I really really liked making this website because after solving Javascript problems the navigation was actually so smooth and just rewarding. I also tried out designing buttons and styling them through CSS , which made them much more visually satisfying.</p>
<p class="introo">> Also - the making of the advertisement was super fun , I tried out a low budget style of ad banner design that you often see on sketchy websites and it was amazing.</p>
