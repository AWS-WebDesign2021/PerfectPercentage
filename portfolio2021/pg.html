<h1 class="sub">'Brief Intro About Website'</h1>
<p class="introo">> This page was about <i>Social and Ethical Issues of IT</i></p>
<p class="introo">> I used the same design and layout as the Taiwan Project - the main focus of this project was animation and transition.</p>
<p class="introo">> More of this website design and production was me exploring hover functionalities and animations.</p>
<p class="introo">> One of the highlights of this website would be the table (as seen on case study page)</p>
<p class="introo">> I really enjoyed the colors I chose for this website , very visually pleasing.</p>

<h1 class="sub">'Reflection'</h1>
<p class="introo">> The making of this website gave me the chance to learn more with keyframes and look into hover functionalities.</p>
<p class="introo">> One of the difficulties I faced when coding this website was that the background animation for the header was very confusing. The sizing kept on going off the grid and it was very much frustrating.</p>
<p class="introo">> However , I was able to get it to work after I used overflow - hidden , so that everything stays within the header sizing.</p>
<p class="introo">> My favorite thing about this website is the transition that appears when hovered over , for example the text boxes (divs) , it was also fairly simple to code.</p>
<p class="introo">> Something to improve would be : make the background animation smoother, it seems a bit glitching when switching between the background images due to sizing problems..</p>
