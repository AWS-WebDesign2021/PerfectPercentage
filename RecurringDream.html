  <h1>facetiming my friend goes wrong</h1>
    <p>Just like every other night,after I return to my room,
    I facetime my friends. I called the first time and nobody picked
  up. I tried calling the second time, still nobody answered.
  Still not giving up, I called the third time. This time somebody
  picked up. Instead of my friend's voice, all I heard was
  screaming and a deep voice saying, "If you don't stop,
  the next is you." <i>Opening my eyes, I took a deep breath.
  It's already the morning. My phone is in my hand. I had once more
  fallen asleep while facetiming my friend in another time zone.</i></p>
